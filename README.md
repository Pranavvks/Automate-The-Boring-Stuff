# What I learnt

### This was a great book which opened my mind to think of ways in which we could automate tasks which are dull or use the command line to do tasks more efficently and in less time. However, I haven't completed all the chapters of this book I will be definitely going through them and I also intend to create something different which is not mentioned in the book by picking up ideas mentioned and learning more about automation.I also tried creating something very basic , a pdf to text converter however I didn't receive the desired output also tried some other 3rd party modules but it too didn't work. Nevertheless , I would definitely find a solution to this one.
