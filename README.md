#What I learnt

## This was a great book which opened my mind to think of ways in which we could automate or use the command line to do tasks more efficently and in less time. However, I haven't completed all the chapters of this book I will be definitely going through them and I also intend to create something different which is not mentioned in the book by picking up ideas mentioned and learning more about automation.
